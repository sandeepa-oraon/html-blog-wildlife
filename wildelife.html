        <div style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
            <p>India is home to a large variety of wildlife. It is a biodiversity hotspot with various ecosystems ranging from the Himalayas in the north to the evergreen rain forests in the south, the sands of the west to the marshy mangroves of the east. India lies within the Indomalayan realm and is the home to about 7.6% of mammal, 14.7% of amphibian, 6% of bird, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.2% of flowering plant species. India's forests contain about 500 species of mammals and more than 2,000 bird species.</p>
            <p>India is one of the most biodiverse regions of the world and include three of the world's 36 biodiversity hotspots â€“ the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, and the Indo-Burma hotspot. It is one of the 17 megadiverse countries. The country has 12 biosphere reserves and 75 Ramsar sites.</p>
            <p>In response to decrease in the numbers of wild animals, human encroachment and poaching activities, the Government of India established a system of national parks and protected areas in 1935, which subsequently expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat. Further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s.</p>

            <h3><u>Geographic origins</u></h3>
            <div style="display: flex;">
                <p>Many Indian species are descendants of species originating in Gondwana, of which India originally was a part. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards, and collision with, the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism in the Deccan Traps and climatic change 20 million years ago caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. Soon thereafter, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes on either side of the emerging Himalayas. As a result, among Indian species, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic, contrasting with 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians Notable endemics are the Nilgiri langur and the brown and carmine Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India harbours 172, or 2.9%, of IUCN-designated threatened species. India is located at the junction of three biogeographic realms: the Afrotropical, Indomalayan and Palearctic, and therefore, has characteristic elements from each of them, spurring migration of avifauna from these regions.</p>

            <h3><u>Conservation</u></h3>
            <p>Article 48 of the Constitution of India says, "The state shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country" and Article 51-A states that "it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures."The committee in the Indian Board for Wildlife, in their report, defines wildlife as "the entire natural uncultivated flora and fauna of the country" while the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 defines it as "any animal, bees, butterflies, crustacea, fish, moths and aquatic or land vegetation which forms part of any habitat."[21]</p>
            <p>Despite the various environmental issues, the country still has rich and varied wildlife.</p>
            <p>As of 2020, there are 981 protected areas including 106 national parks, 566 wildlife sanctuaries, 97 conservation reserves and 214 community reserves. In addition there are 51 tiger reserves, 18 biosphere reserves and 32 elephant reserves.[citation needed] Hundreds of India's bird species are in serious decline, according to a study spanning over 25 years.In 2020 the Indian government created the world's first sea cucumber reserve in Lakshadweep â€“ Dr KK Mohammed Koya Sea Cucumber Conservation Reserve, the largest marine conservation reserve â€“ Attakoya Thangal Marine Reserve and the first protected area for marine birds in India â€“ PM Sayeed Marine Birds Conservation Reserve.</p>
            <p>Gir forest in India has the only surviving population of Asiatic lions in the world. In the late 1960s, there were only about 180 Asiatic lions. There were more than 600 Asiatic lions in Gir National Park in 2018.</p>

            <h3><u>Extinctions in recent times</u></h3>
            <p>Some bird species have gone extinct in recent times, including the pink-headed duck (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea) and the Himalayan quail (Ophrysia superciliosa). The large-billed reed warbler (Acrocephalus orinus), known from a single specimen collected by Allan Octavian Hume from near Rampur in Himachal Pradesh, was rediscovered in Thailand after 139 years.</p>
            <p>The Asiatic cheetah became extinct in India in the 1950. India's last recorded cheetah in the wild was said to have been shot in the Rewa area of Madhya Pradesh in the late 1940s.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Gir National Park is the only place in the world to have a large healthy population of lions. Other than Gir, Bannerghatta is the only park with lions in India. It is also known as the Sasan Gir â€“ a forest and wildlife sanctuary. Located in Gujarat, the park has almost 700 Asiatic lions whose population has risen by 29% between 2015-2020. Apart from lions, the park also has Bengal fox, jungle cat, Asiatic wildcat, Indian leopard, golden jackal, and striped hyena. After spending some time on a game drive, visitors can head over to some of the nearest attractions such as the Somnath Temple, Durbar Hall Museum, and the Nalsarovar Lake, which happens to be a bird paradise. Gir National park and Wildlife Sanctuary remains closed for the monsoons. Therefore, visitors can only plan a trip during Winters and Summer from October to May when the weather is calm.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">This park in northern India is one of the best places to spot the royal Bengal tiger that are most active between November and May. It is named after a historic fortress nearby and surrounded by two rivers. With plenty of jungle for its famous big cats, the park was home to one of the first recorded instances of a male tiger raising his cubs; Zalim â€“ the tiger â€“ cared for his offspring when their mother died. The most popular and best way to discover the park is on a morning or evening game drive, giving you access to an impressive list of wildlife, including tigers, leopards, crocodiles and monkeys.</p>

It is also a tiger reserve with one of the highest concentrations of royal Bengal tigers (over 400). The Sundarbans get their name from the mangrove tree, Sundari, that grows ferociously around the delta. Sundarban hosts wildlife species such as dog-faced water snake, red-tailed bamboo pit viper, rat snake, and checkered keelback. Saltwater crocodile, royal Bengal tiger, and hawksbill turtle are of the parkâ€™s most endangered species. For tiger viewing, visitors can go to Sudhanyakhali or Sajnekhali watchtowers.  </p>
